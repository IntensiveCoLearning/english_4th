## Self-introduction

在web2苦苦打工的bd，认为web3、去中心化是改变世界的。二月份参加了consensus，遇到了参加实习计划的大家，觉得很有活力，驱散了让我死气沉沉的班味，想进入web3，想保持活力，想和大家在一起～

My ultimate goal in joining this learning group is to develop a better feel for English. If I'm ever kidnapped to an English-speaking country, at least I can still ask for the direction and get some food in English. (🤪Yes, I'm a foodie).

Here’s what I’ve done today (mainly preparation based on the materials provided on the Intensive Learning website):

1.  Going through the files and other resources, among which I found some really useful, like the EnglishPod [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1w7411g7jn/](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1w7411g7jn/). I really like its vibe - no "fancy" vocabulary, no pressure, yet the usage of the words and phrases sound so native. I think I’ll mainly use this as the core material for my learning plan.
    
2.  Writing - Adjusting my AI prompts to improve my English expressions (Just like how I modify my learning journal right now)
    
3.  Reading & Listening - Adding some listening materials to my favorite, so that I can easily access to them when I commute, work, and even sleep.
    
4.  Speaking - Getting in touch with my foreign friends and creating opportunities to speak English daily.
