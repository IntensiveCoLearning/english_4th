## Self-introduction

Hi, I’m Qiuyi. I’m currently in the Bay Area and studying computer science prerequisite courses. I have a bachelor’s degree in Financial Management and two years of experience: audit at a Big 8 accounting firm and operations management at a Top 500 real estate company. Now I’m moving into Web3, especially smart contract auditing. Improving my English is very important for my next step.
