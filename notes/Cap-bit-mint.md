## Self-introduction

Hi I'm eden. I deeply resonate with the phrase, "The boundary of language is the boundary of thought." Even now, when I communicate in English, I often find myself translating in my head, which significantly hampers the fluency of my expression and thinking.  I look forward to engaging in sincere conversations with everyone in this community, drawing inspiration from each other.
