### PRELUDE

About this notes, I intend to practice my writing skills. Probably, this will be a public 21-day-diary. Besides that, maybe I will write something else like my own learning skills, my thoughts, or my feelings about life. Welcome you guys reading my notes to come and find me on X and Telegram: @JaggerLam

Today’s authentication lyrics:

stay with me…真夜中のドアをたたき~ 帰らないでと泣いた~ あの季節が 今 目の前

stay with me…口ぐせを言いながら~ 二人の瞬間を抱いて~ まだ忘れず 暖めてた

I really like this city-pop huge-hit, _真夜中のドア〜stay with me_, despite the passage of time. Someday, I will sing this song to my beloved-one.

### Tracks (Or diaries, whatever)

The Spring Festival is about to end, and the English intensive co-learning started today. Honestly, I didn’t have a fine-grained plan to execute in this co-learning because of the happy holidays.

The other reason I didn’t create my English-learning plan is today I was occupied with updating myself on the project progress of PUSDC, a crypto entrepreneurial project which focuses on e-mail transactions and transaction privacy. Due to the requirements of this project, I tried to install a lightweight AI-Agent called Nanobot. But, I found that if I install this agent-service on my local laptop, then it’s hard to keep this service running all day. Maybe I should buy a VPS to solve this problem.

Still, it‘s a good chance for me to practice English, so the fine-grained plan should be made as soon as possible. I intend to make this plan with my partner, Zoya, in the next few days.
